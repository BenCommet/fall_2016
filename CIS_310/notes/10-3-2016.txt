@def cocitation - for two nodes Vi and Vj, cocitation is the number of other nodes that point to both Vi and Vj
* For example in a citation network two papers that are both cited by many other papers probably have the same topic
@def Bibliographic Coupling - like cocitation only in the opposite direction, ex: two papers that cite many common sources are probably about similar topics
@def reciprocity - a driced network where links link back to one another
@def common neighbors - a count of the number of common neighbors that two nodes have
@title Network Metrics
@def composites - averages of node or node pair metrics, average degree, closeness, betweenness, clustering coef, etc
@def diameter - longest geodesic path
* diameter of the web is 19 (measured in 1999)
