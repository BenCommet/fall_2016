@def directed acyclic networks - are directed with no cycles, useful for searches
# Procedure to determine if network is directed acyclic
	1. search for a node with no outgoing links
	2. if there are none it is cyclic. otherwise remove the selected node and all its incoming links
	3. if all vertices have been removed, it is acyclic, otherwise go back to step 1
@def Bipartite Graphs - you can partition the graphs nodes into two sets and there can be links between nodes of different sets but not between nodes of the same set
* 2 mode networks are bipartite
@def Trees - graphs without closed loops, not a problem for transversal, any node can be root node
@def minimum spanning tree - used for weighted graphs to find the minimum weights between nodes
