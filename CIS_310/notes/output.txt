@title General Social Network Stuff
@def social network - a group of people and the dyadic relationships between them
@title Electronic Representations of Networks
@def scalar - linear algebra structure for holding single numbers
@def vector - linear algebra structure for holding one dimensional row or column of numbers (array with direction)
@def matrix - linear algebra structure for holding two dimensional array  
@def n = number of nodes
@def m - number of links

@title Nodes and Links
* Nodes represent objects eg: node = new Node(foo, bar);
* Links - relationship between 2 nodes
# Link Attributes:
	1. Type - nature of link eg. friendship, father-of, carbon-bond
	2. Weight - numerical measurement that can describe the strength of the link
	3. Direction - implies that the relationship is one-way, examples include father-of, follows, eats. Directed can go in both directions, typically designated by arrows, undirected is monodirectional

* Graphs are used to refer only to nodes and links
* Networks contains the graph and the node attributes
* Figure out what is important and then use those, keep groups of nodes together as much as possible

* early 20th century, sociologist became interested in social networks and the social dynamics
* Milgrims small world letter thing
* Granovetter's "strenth of weak ties" in 1973
* We can do a lot more with networks these days, what the the plumtooters and what not
@def directed acyclic networks - are directed with no cycles, useful for searches
# Procedure to determine if network is directed acyclic
	1. search for a node with no outgoing links
	2. if there are none it is cyclic. otherwise remove the selected node and all its incoming links
	3. if all vertices have been removed, it is acyclic, otherwise go back to step 1
@def Bipartite Graphs - you can partition the graphs nodes into two sets and there can be links between nodes of different sets but not between nodes of the same set
* 2 mode networks are bipartite
@def Trees - graphs without closed loops, not a problem for transversal, any node can be root node
@def minimum spanning tree - used for weighted graphs to find the minimum weights between nodes

@title Metrics
# centrality metrics
	1. degree
	2. closeness - measure of the length in the shortest paths between a node and every other node in the network
	3. betweenness - measure how close a node is to every other node in the network
	4. edgesomething - 
@title Real Networks
* stars - start with one node: a has friends B, C, D, E, and F
* D has ACFG & H then combine the trees
@def one mode network - contains only one thing (eg: students)
@def two mode network - contains two things (eg: students and their courses)
* overlapping cliques are a bunch of peeps who know are in two seperate groups and know each other
@fx number of links in fully connected network = n(n - 1)/2 -> n = number of nodes
@def internetworking - procedure for connecting 2 or more networks
