#Types of Heresy
	1. ignorance - you weren't taught correctly or never had access to the right doctrine, this isn't a sin
	2. formal heresy - you do know the correct doctrine, and you have chosen to either not believe it or to believe only a portion of it
@def sacrilidge - defiling something holy, more about action than belief 
* middle of 15th century witchcraft begins to be treated as heresy
