@title Cumulative Concept of Witchcraft

* We now have a way to prosecute witches

* Church courts prosecuted heresy, sacrilidge, any crime committed by and against the clergy and all crimes related to marriage and sexuality
* A lot of tension and competition over jursisdiction
* Any punishment involving bodily harm given by the church courts had to be laid down by the secular courts
@def accusatorial justice - had to be initiated by a private person who prosecuted the case, if not resolved trial by the ordeal
@def ordeal - god would back you up if you were right, injuries were given, or duals were fought
* At the 4th Lateran Council the church decided no clergy could particpate in accusitorial justice and that torture can be used to get the truth from individuals
* This causes a switch to the inquisitorial system of justice
@def inquisitorial system of justice - could be initiated by private party, or an official can step in and start the process. Court officials are responsible for prosecuting the case. Standards of evidence finally start to be produced. 
@heresy - beliefs that are not orthodox, believing in the wrong things, usually done by picking bits and pieces of Christianity
@infidelity - not believing in Jesus
